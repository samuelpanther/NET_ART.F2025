  Amalia Soto, aka Molly Soda, began exploring, at a young age, what it means to grow up on the internet, alone and with countless unknown others. 
  Much of her online work—which includes webcam recordings, zines, Tumblr posts, selfie archives, and YouTube videos—shamelessly embraces and 
  interrogates the internet, especially social media, and its role in the formation of self. She documents the labor of being visible on the internet, 
  the exhausting work of curating and performing 'yourself' for an audience that's always watching (or so you hope). She celebrates aesthetics that 
  women get mocked for: oversharing, sentimentality, and digital, emotional, and physical clutter—reclaiming personal messiness and imperfection, 
  staking a claim that this culture is worthy of serious attention.
